## Algorithms List
Algorithm | Description
--|--
Russian Peasant Multiplication Algorithm | In the Russian peasant method, the powers of two in the decomposition of the multiplicand are found by writing it on the left and progressively halving the left column, discarding any remainder, until the value is 1 (or âˆ’1, in which case the eventual sum is negated), while doubling the right column as before. Lines with even numbers on the left column are struck out, and the remaining numbers on the right are added together. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_multiplication)
3Sum A & B | In computational complexity theory, the 3SUM problem asks if a given set of n real numbers contains three elements that sum to zero. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3SUM)
Nth Fibonacci Number | In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F<sub>n</sub>, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. This section contains different approaches including the iterative approach, recursive approach and also the memoization approach. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci)
Tower of Hanoi | The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi)
Bubble Sort | Bubble Sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
Selection Sort | Selection Sort divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list. Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging (swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)
Insertion Sort | Insertion Sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and growing a sorted output list. At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there. It repeats until no input elements remain. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)
Shell Sort | Shell Sort starts by sorting pairs of elements far apart from each other, then progressively reducing the gap between elements to be compared. Starting with far apart elements, it can move some out-of-place elements into position faster than a simple nearest neighbor exchange. The running time of Shell Sort is heavily dependent on the gap sequence it uses. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort)
Bogo Sort | Bogo Sort is a highly inefficient sorting algorithm based on the generate and test paradigm. The function successively generates permutations of its input until it finds one that is sorted. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort)
Merge Sort | Merge Sort divides the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted). It repeatedly merges sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining to get the final sorted list - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
Quick Sort | Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This can be done in-place, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)

## Analysis

### Russian Peasant Multiplication Algorithm
How the algorithm works is fairly simple and can be illustrated using an example.  
  
#### Example: 85 x 18
Power | Binary Digit | First Number | Second Number
--|--|--|--
2<sup>0</sup> | 1 | 85 | 18
2<sup>1</sup> | 0 | 42 | 36
2<sup>2</sup> | 1 | 21 | 72
2<sup>3</sup> | 0 | 10 | 144
2<sup>4</sup> | 1 | 5 | 288
2<sup>5</sup> | 0 | 2 | 576
2<sup>6</sup> | 1 | 1 | 1152

We can see that by halving the first number, we will essentially get the binary representation of the first number in reverse (read from bottom up), in this example 18 = 1010101<sub>2</sub>.
In the algorithm, we only keep track of odd numbers, which is essentially the 1s in the binary representation, hence 85 x 18 can be simplified to  
(2<sup>0</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup> + 2<sup>6</sup>) * 18 = 1 * 18 + 4 * 18 + 16 * 18 + 64 * 18
  
#### Runtime
Attribute | Performance
--|--
Overall Runtime | O(log n), since we are halving the first number repeatedly
Worst Case | O(log n)
Best Case | O(log n)

#### Performance

[Graph Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_KWGXFESAdKmmsv-7X7g6ot7kqFwDrlZDvbGtQFJGfg/edit?usp=sharing "Graph Link")

From the graph, we can see that there's a huge spike at the very front, that is most likely due to a heavyweight initialization process. The time to complete it is included in the first measurement. Subsequent calls proceeded down the fast path where the state was already initialized.    
Overall, we can see that the runtime of the algorithm grows very slowly relative to the input (even approaching 2<sup>31</sup> - 1) and resembles O(log n) growth which is very close to constant time O(1) performance.

### 3Sum Algorithm
#### 3SumA
For 3SumA it works by using three nested for loops. The performance suffers as the runtime is O(n<sup>3</sup>).  

##### Runtime of 3SumA  
Attribute | Performance
--|--
Overall Runtime | O(n<sup>3</sup>)

##### Performance of 3SumA

![3SumAGraph](/src/graphs/3SumA.png)

[Graph Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oHA2O2ycLp78JbFN_iGmzpGkTrE2-W9NtBgp_TVLw24/edit?usp=sharing "Graph Link")

From the graph, we can see that for 3SumA the graph fits almost perfectly with a n<sup>3</sup> polynomial, so this further
consolidates our previous asymptotic analysis result.

#### 3SumB
For 3SumB, the array is sorted (O(n log n)) first and there are two for loops and a binary search. The overall runtime is O(n<sup>2</sup> log n).

##### Runtime of 3SumB 
Attribute | Performance
--|--
Overall Runtime | O(n<sup>2</sup> log n)

##### Performance of 3SumB

![3SumBGraph](/src/graphs/3SumB.png)

[Graph Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oHA2O2ycLp78JbFN_iGmzpGkTrE2-W9NtBgp_TVLw24/edit?usp=sharing "Graph Link")

From the graph, we can see that for 3SumB the graph also looks like a quadratic graph, however it's not possible to fit a n<sup>2</sup> log n line on google sheets unfortunately.

#### 3Sum Comparison

[Graph Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oHA2O2ycLp78JbFN_iGmzpGkTrE2-W9NtBgp_TVLw24/edit?usp=sharing "Graph Link")

If we compare both 3SumA and 3SumB we can see that there's a massive difference in terms of performance. 3SumB performed much better than 3SumA, because O(n<sup>2</sup> log n) behaves like O(n<sup>2</sup>) if the input is large enough. Effectively speaking we are comparing O(n<sup>2</sup>) against O(n<sup>3</sup>), as the latter has a higher degree, it will perform much worse than its counterpart.

### Nth Fibonacci Number Algorithm
#### Recursive Approach
The common recursive approach is clean and elegant but it suffers in terms of performance due a lot of redundant and repetitive calculations. The runtime complexity for this approach would be O(2<sup>n</sup>) since we are almost making twice the number of calls of the previous level, and there are n-levels. So, if we solve 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... and there are n terms, we can use the [Geometric Series Sum formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series#Formula) to get the value 2<sup>n</sup> - 1. Hence, we can conclude that the runtime is exponential (O(2<sup>n</sup>)). The space complexity will be O(n) because the deepest level is the nth level. The first call is completed before the second call hence the maximum stack space the algorithm can occupy is n frames. The best case is O(1) when the input is 0 or 1.

##### Runtime of Recursive Approach
Attribute | Performance
--|--
Overall Runtime | O(2<sup>n</sup>)
Worst Case | O(2<sup>n</sup>)
Best Case | O(1)
Space Complexity | O(n)

##### Performance of Recursive Approach
![Fibonacci_Recursive](/src/graphs/Fibonacci_Recursive.png)

[Graph Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ghyVCJWkgRQJNJfwR7eqcm_3EkmPnlMrbv5TFEhdTSo/edit?usp=sharing "Graph Link")

From the graph, we can see that for the recursive approach the graph fits almost perfectly with an exponential function, so this further consolidates our previous asymptotic analysis result.

#### Iterative Approach
The runtime complexity of the iterative approach is clearly linear O(n), as the loop runs from 2 to n, which means it's O(n) time. Note that for this approach, the space complexity O(1) since it does not take up any extra space. The best case is O(1) which is similar to the recursive approach.

##### Runtime of Iterative Approach 
Attribute | Performance
--|--
Overall Runtime | O(n)
Worst Case | O(n)
Best Case | O(1)
Space Complexity | O(1)

##### Performance of Iterative Approach
![Fibonacci_Iterative](/src/graphs/Fibonacci_Iterative.png)

[Graph Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ghyVCJWkgRQJNJfwR7eqcm_3EkmPnlMrbv5TFEhdTSo/edit?usp=sharing "Graph Link")

From the graph, we can see that for the iterative approach the graph fits displayed a linear pattern. So, we can conclude the runtime is indeed linear.

#### Memoization Approach
In computing, memoization or memoisation is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. For this particular problem, we can use an auxiliary array (or any reasonable data structure) for caching previously computed answers. By doing this, we truncate the other branch of the execution tree to obtain linear performance O(n). It works by first checking the array for previously computed answers, if so, return the answer directly. Or else, it computes the answer and stores it in the array for future use. This is also an excellent example of dynamic programming, where the idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later.

##### Runtime of Memoization Approach 
Attribute | Performance
--|--
Overall Runtime | O(n)
Worst Case | O(n)
Best Case | O(1)
Space Complexity | O(n)

##### Memoization Approach
![Fibonacci_Memoization](/src/graphs/Fibonacci_Memoization.png)

[Graph Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ghyVCJWkgRQJNJfwR7eqcm_3EkmPnlMrbv5TFEhdTSo/edit?usp=sharing "Graph Link")

From the graph, we can see that for the memoization approach the graph fits displayed a sublinear pattern. There are spikes at when the input is small but it stabilises as a linear line when n is after 18. 

#### Fibonacci Comparison
![Fibonacci_Comparison](/src/graphs/Fibonacci_Comparison.png)

[Graph Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ghyVCJWkgRQJNJfwR7eqcm_3EkmPnlMrbv5TFEhdTSo/edit?usp=sharing "Graph Link")

If we compare all the approaches, we can see that there's a massive difference in terms of performance. The iterative and the memoization approach performed much better than the recursive approach since we are comparing two O(n) algorithms against O(2<sup>n</sup>), as the latter has a higher degree, it will perform much worse than its counterparts.

### Tower of Hanoi Algorithm
This problem can be elegantly solved using recursion. 
The algorithm consists of the following steps:  
1. Move n - 1 disks to the mid tower
2. Move the last disk to the destination
3. Move the n - 1 from the mid tower to the destination
There is a total of 2 recursive calls with (n - 1) disks as the input, so similar to the Fibonacci recursive algorithm, we can see that the tree height is n and we are making twice the number of calls of the previous level. Hence the runtime is exponential (O(2<sup>n</sup>)). The space complexity will be O(n) because the deepest level is the nth level. The first call is completed before the second call hence the maximum stack space the algorithm can occupy is n frames. The best case is O(1) when the input is 1.

[Graph Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pINJeaU_bLvGYepocz3DMri5iCqDiT0IfOk2azq-Whs/edit?usp=sharing "Graph Link")

From the graph, we can see that the graph fits almost perfectly with an exponential function, so the runtime (order of growth) of the algorithm is O(2<sup>n</sup>).

### Bubble Sort
In each iteration of Bubble Sort, we swap each element pair if the first element is bigger than the second element. At the nth iteration, it's guaranteed that the nth largest element is in their correct place. We can see that there are two for loops where the indices of the second for loop depends on the first for loop, so the runtime complexity is quadratic. From a geometrical standpoint, for each outer loop iteration, the inner loop iteration count decreases by 1, so it resembles a triangular shape. We know that the area of the triangle is can be calculated by 1/2 * base * height, as the base and the height are the same, the runtime complexity can be calculated as follows O(n<sup>2</sup>/2) = O(n<sup>2</sup>). For this specific implementation, the worst case is O(n<sup>2</sup>) but can be shortened to O(n) if we terminate the method as soon as we encounter a 0-swap iteration (array already sorted).
  
#### Runtime

Overall Runtime | O(n<sup>2</sup>)
Worst Case | O(n<sup>2</sup>)
Best Case | O(n<sup>2</sup>)

[Graph Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K42GfhnHgZ4xDVeytyaHNN5rqhDBLk0ozXtFv1bUDzE/edit?usp=sharing "Graph Link")

From the graph, we can see that the graph fits almost perfectly with a quadratic polynomial, so the runtime (order of growth) of the algorithm is indeed O(n<sup>2</sup>).

### Selection Sort
For each iteration of Selection Sort, we find the i-th smallest element in the array and swaps it with the current i-th element. Similar to Bubble Sort as there are two for loops and the iteration of the inner for loop decreases by one for each iteration of the outer loop, we can simply the sum of n + (n - 1) + (n - 2) + ... 3 + 2 + 1 using the sum from [1 to N formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_%2B_2_%2B_3_%2B_4_%2B_%E2%8B%AF) to get n * (n + 1) / 2, so the runtime complexity is O(n<sup>2</sup>).
#### Runtime

[Graph Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K42GfhnHgZ4xDVeytyaHNN5rqhDBLk0ozXtFv1bUDzE/edit?usp=sharing "Graph Link")

From the graph
, we can see that the graph fits almost perfectly with a quadratic polynomial, so the runtime (order of growth) of the algorithm is indeed O(n<sup>2</sup>).

### Insertion Sort
At each iteration, insertion sort takes the next i-th element and inserts it to its appropriate place in the sorted section of the array. In the worst case, the element would need to be placed at the start of the array if it's the smallest element we have encountered so far. Hence, we can see that the runtime complexity will be O(n<sup>2</sup>) as for each element the worst case is O(n). An interesting observation is the fact that if the provided array is in descending order it will be considered the worst case since each element would need to be moved to the start of the array for each iteration. Insertion sort only takes one iteration to complete if the array is already sorted and performs very well on partially sorted small arrays.
#### Runtime

[Graph Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K42GfhnHgZ4xDVeytyaHNN5rqhDBLk0ozXtFv1bUDzE/edit?usp=sharing "Graph Link")

From the graph, we can see that the graph fits almost perfectly with a quadratic polynomial, so the runtime (order of growth) of the algorithm is indeed O(n<sup>2</sup>).

### Shell Sort
Shell sort is a subtle improvement of insertion sort, instead of moving one position at a time, we make jumps to move the smaller elements to the front of the array faster. The sequence used for this implementation of Shell Sort is the Knuth Sequence where the kth element in the sequence is defined as (3<sup>k</sup>-1)/2 and bounded by N/3 (1, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, ...). We can obtain linearithmic performance O(n log n) for the best case and O(n<sup>3/2</sup>) for the worst case.
#### Runtime

Worst Case | O(n<sup>3/2</sup>)

[Graph Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K42GfhnHgZ4xDVeytyaHNN5rqhDBLk0ozXtFv1bUDzE/edit?usp=sharing "Graph Link")

From the graph, we can see that the algorithm performs very well and grows almost linearly even when the input is quite large. However, the performance is inconsistent as there are multiple spikes in the graph.

### Bogo Sort
Bogo-sort is equivalent to repeatedly throwing a deck of cards in the air, picking them up at random, and then testing whether they are in order. It performs extremely badly and should not be used at all.
#### Runtime
Attribute | Performance
--|--
Average Case | O(n * n!)
Worst Case | O(âˆž), might go on forever
Best Case | O(n), array already sorted

[Graph Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K42GfhnHgZ4xDVeytyaHNN5rqhDBLk0ozXtFv1bUDzE/edit?usp=sharing "Graph Link")

From the graph, we can see that the algorithm is inconsistent as it relies on probability, as the input size grows, and when n > 13 it will take an extraordinary amount of time to compute as the factorial function grows even faster than an exponential algorithm.

### Elementary Sorts Comparison

![SlowSortsGraph](/src/graphs/Slow_Sorts.png)

[Graph Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L8M2HLUyXZ69qncev7MBSP7mjc3p310YiYvOXW1R_n0/edit?usp=sharing "Graph Link")

When we compare the all the elementary sorts listed above, we can see that bubble sort performs the worst, as it requires kxn comparisons, where k is the maximum distance between an entry's starting position and its ending position, which is usually larger than n/2 for uniformly distributed initial values (assuming random entries). Insertion Sort performs better than Selection Sort since the best case for Insertion Sort is O(n) and for each i-th iteration, there can be less than i comparison whereas for Selection Sort, it is guaranteed that there will be exactly (n - i) comparisons for the i-th iteration. Shell Sort performs the best among all elementary sorting algorithms as it is more asymptotically efficient than the other algorithms by making jumps. (reducing the number of swaps)
