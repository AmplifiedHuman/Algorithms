Russian Peasant Multiplication Algorithm | In the Russian peasant method, the powers of two in the decomposition of the multiplicand are found by writing it on the left and progressively halving the left column, discarding any remainder, until the value is 1 (or âˆ’1, in which case the eventual sum is negated), while doubling the right column as before. Lines with even numbers on the left column are struck out, and the remaining numbers on the right are added together.


## Analysis

### Russian Peasant Multiplication Algorithm
How the algorithm works is fairly simple and can be illustrated using an example.  
  
**Example: 85 x 18**
Power | Binary Digit | First Number | Second Number
--|--|--|--
2<sup>0</sup> | 1 | 85 | 18
2<sup>1</sup> | 0 | 42 | 36
2<sup>2</sup> | 1 | 21 | 72
2<sup>3</sup> | 0 | 10 | 144
2<sup>4</sup> | 1 | 5 | 288
2<sup>5</sup> | 0 | 2 | 576
2<sup>6</sup> | 1 | 1 | 1152

We can see that by halving the first number, we will essentially get the binary representation of the first number in reverse (read from bottom up), in this example 18 = 1010101<sub>2</sub>.
In the algorithm, we only keep track of odd numbers, which is essentially the 1s in the binary representation, hence 85 x 18 can be simplified to  
(2<sup>0</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup> + 2<sup>6</sup>) * 18 = 1 * 18 + 4 * 18 + 16 * 18 + 64 * 18
  
**Runtime**
Attribute | Performance
--|--
Overall Runtime | O(log n), since we are halving the first number repeatedly
Worst Case | O(log n)
Best Case | O(log n)
